# lammps-projects

This repository contains the scripts required to run and analyze all of my LAMMPS calculations. 
Git LFS is required to download the structure and potential files.
The scripts expect the environment variables `LAMMPS_SERIAL_BIN` and `LAMMPS_MPI_BIN` to point to the location of serial and mpi enabled versions of LAMMPS respectively.
